Coconut Trees Detection and Segmentation
========================================
This repo provided supplementary material for our paper **Coconut Trees Detection and Segmentationin Aerial Imagery using Mask R-CNN** - published in IET Computer Vision.
### Status Update - ~~December 2020~~ April 2021:
The paper is ~~accepted for publication~~ **published** in IET Computer Vision. Here is the link [!https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/cvi2.12028](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/cvi2.12028)


The following images are provided as a sample output on the coconut trees detection task. 
The repository will be updated and necessary code will be provided to the user for their own tasks on trees detection.
The work in this repo borrows the Mask R-CNN code from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN


The output images are placed in `detection` and `segmentation` folders.
